        <h2>About My Class</h2>
        <p>
            My class that I am including in this webpage is Music 202. Music 202 is Rock N Roll History II from 1975-Present. This 
            class goes over the history of rock music from the year 1975 to the present day. So far we have covered mainstream rock in 
            the seventies, punk rock, and new wave music.
        </p>
        <h2>Fun Facts about Rock History II</h2>
        <p style="font-size: 9pt">
            Some fun facts about this class are that it takes place entirely online due to social distancing concerns and university protocol.
            This class also has its textbook provided by TopHat instead of by a physical medium or other online service. Most of the songs that 
            we study in this class are available on the Spotify streaming service. And finally, a shocking and perhaps the most important fact is that 
            you don't need any web development experience to take this class!
