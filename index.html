            The Initial page will have your name, hometown, major, and a paragraph of whatever text you want to
            offer. I need to see enough text such that it can demonstrate the auto formatting/wrapping that
            browsers do by default on paragraphs of text. You also need an image or two. I don't care what the
            images are as long as they are appropriate. :-) It would be a good idea to resize them, if needed. You
            should be able to do this with just about any image editing software. For Windows I like Paint.NET. It’s
            free (it started as a student project at a University) and has all the features I need. The initial page also
            needs to have links to your two other pages. Name this webpage index.html, there will be more
            discussion later about the significance of this file name.
