        <h1 style="color: darkslategray">About my Major</h1>
        <p>
            My major at UND is Information Systems, and I am completing it through the Nistler College of Business and Public Administration. 
            With this program, not only will I graduate with skills in identifying hardware, sofware, and proficiencies in software used by businesses,
            but I will also have skills in big data analytics, programming, and other higher level applications of my knowledge.
        </p>
        <p style="font-size: 14pt">
            Another cool thing about Information Systems as a major is that it also includes all of the business core courses because it it through the school of business.
            That means that students graduating with this major will have experience in economics, finance, management, accounting, and others. 
            This allows Information Systems majors to have a wider skill set, and also apply their knowledge in a business context.
        </p>
        <h2>Here's a picture of a computer that I was working on recently</h2>
        <p>
            I used the skills that I've acquired through my major to set it up and do some data analytics on it.
