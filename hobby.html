            <h2>Running is totally tubular</h2><br />
            One of my hobbies that I enjoy is running. To date I have ran two half marathons and two full marathons.
            The last race that I've completed is the Sanford Health Fargo Half Marathon this fall.
            Because of Covid-19, I had to complete this race virtually and not in person. I am hoping that 
            this fall I can sign up again, and this time compete in person.
