        <p>
            One of my hobbies that I enjoy is running. To date I have ran two half marathons and two full marathons.
            The last race that I've completed is the Sanford Health Fargo Half Marathon this fall.
            Because of Covid-19, I had to complete this race virtually and not in person. I am hoping that 
            this fall I can sign up again, and this time compete in person.

            This is an additional paragraph that is formatted differently than the other paragraph. This paragraph
            has been formatted with an inline CSS style change. The inline CSS style change has made this paragraph appear
            in 8pt font. 8pt font is smaller than the font size that has been set in the css file that sets the formating 
            for the rest of this page.
